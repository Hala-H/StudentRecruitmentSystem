## About
An internal system to assist the admission department in the recruitment of new students. The system is an effective tool that will facilitate the tracking of students’ information, schools’ information, activities’ information and provide reports.

## Motivation
This project was done for CS 2111 Web Application Development course at university. The main purpose for this system is to ogranize and automate the process. The current system they use is simply Excel sheets. This is difficult to maintain and lots of information gets lost in the middle. With our tool, we can safely and securely store and manage the data. The dashboard offers a brief statistical preview of the data. We can easily import and export new data and track potential students, schools and activites done.
